## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### High-Risk Tasks
- **Task 2.2 (Incremental Refresh Engine)**: Complex change detection and state management
  - *Mitigation*: Start with simplified change detection, iterate to more sophisticated approaches
- **Task 2.4 (Dependency Management)**: Circular dependency detection and cascade failure handling
  - *Mitigation*: Implement comprehensive testing with various dependency scenarios
- **Task 3.3 (Alerting System)**: Real-time alert delivery and notification reliability
  - *Mitigation*: Design with fallback mechanisms and comprehensive error handling

### Medium-Risk Tasks
- **Task 1.3 (TPC-H Dataset Loading)**: Large dataset generation and loading performance
  - *Mitigation*: Implement parallel loading and optimize for development cycle efficiency
- **Task 3.1 (Data Validation Engine)**: Performance with large datasets and complex rules
  - *Mitigation*: Design for incremental validation and efficient rule processing

### Dependencies Management
- Database schema (Task 1.2) is critical path for all data-related tasks
- API framework (Task 1.4) required for all backend feature development
- Frontend setup (Task 1.5) needed for all UI development
- Core engines (Tasks 2.1-2.3) must be stable before building dependent features

### Resource Allocation Recommendations
- **Weeks 1-3**: 2 developers focus on infrastructure, 1-2 on database design
- **Weeks 4-11**: All developers on core features, with senior developer on complex engines
- **Weeks 12-14**: Split between testing/integration and frontend development
- **Weeks 15-17**: Focus on documentation, deployment, and final validation

### Quality Gates
- **End of Phase 1**: All infrastructure functional, database schema complete
- **End of Phase 2**: Core refresh engines working with sample pipelines
- **End of Phase 3**: All features integrated with comprehensive testing
- **End of Phase 4**: Documentation complete, deployment ready
- **End of Phase 5**: Production ready with user validation complete
