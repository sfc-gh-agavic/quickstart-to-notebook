# PRD: Dynamic Tables Demo System

## Executive Summary

We are building a comprehensive demo system that replicates Snowflake's Dynamic Tables functionality - a declarative approach to defining and managing data pipelines that continuously materialize query results. This system will showcase the complete spectrum of Dynamic Tables capabilities including **incremental refresh patterns**, **full refresh strategies**, **cascading pipeline dependencies**, **data validation**, **automated alerting**, and **comprehensive monitoring** through an interactive web-based demo platform.

The demo will highlight critical differences between incremental and full refresh modes using realistic business scenarios based on the TPC-H dataset, demonstrating everything from real-time order analytics (1-minute LAG incremental refresh) to complex monthly reporting (daily full refresh) and advanced dependency chains.

**Key Business Impact:**
- **Demonstrates Modern Pipeline Patterns**: Shows both incremental (cost-efficient, real-time) and full refresh (accuracy-focused, batch) approaches
- **Hands-on Learning Platform**: Interactive environment for understanding Dynamic Tables LAG configuration, dependency management, and refresh strategies
- **Real-world Business Scenarios**: Complete TPC-H dataset with order processing, customer analytics, product performance, and data quality monitoring
- **Operational Excellence**: Comprehensive alerting, monitoring, and troubleshooting capabilities for production-ready pipelines

**Success Metrics:**
- Interactive demo environment with < 2 second response times for queries
- Complete replication of incremental and full refresh Dynamic Tables patterns
- 8+ working pipeline examples with different LAG settings and refresh modes
- Real-time monitoring dashboard with dependency visualization and performance analytics
