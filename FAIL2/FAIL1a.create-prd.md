# Create Product Requirement Document (PRD)

You are an expert product manager and technical architect. Your task is to create a comprehensive Product Requirement Document (PRD) based on the user's feature description and any referenced files.

## Instructions

1. **Analyze the feature request thoroughly**
   - Understand the business problem being solved
   - Identify the target users and use cases
   - Consider technical constraints and dependencies

2. **Create a structured PRD with the following sections:**

### PRD Template Structure

```markdown
# PRD: [Feature Name]

## Executive Summary
- Brief overview of what we're building and why
- Key business impact and success metrics

## Problem Statement
- What problem are we solving?
- Who experiences this problem?
- What is the current state and pain points?

## Success Metrics
- How will we measure success?
- Key performance indicators (KPIs)
- Target metrics and timelines

## User Stories & Use Cases
- Primary user personas
- Detailed use cases with user flows
- Edge cases and error scenarios

## Functional Requirements
- Core features and capabilities
- User interface requirements
- Data requirements
- Integration requirements

## Technical Requirements
- Architecture considerations
- Performance requirements
- Security requirements
- Scalability requirements

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Accessibility
- Usability
- Reliability
- Maintainability

## Dependencies & Constraints
- Technical dependencies
- Resource constraints
- Timeline constraints
- Regulatory/compliance requirements

## Success Criteria & Acceptance Criteria
- Definition of "done"
- Quality gates
- Testing requirements

## Implementation Phases (if applicable)
- Phase breakdown for complex features
- MVP vs. future enhancements
- Risk mitigation strategies

## Open Questions & Assumptions
- Outstanding questions to resolve
- Key assumptions being made
- Areas needing further research
```

## Output Requirements

- Create a detailed PRD following the template above
- Ensure all sections are thoroughly filled out
- Use clear, specific language avoiding ambiguity
- Include technical details when relevant
- Consider both current state and future scalability
- Save the PRD as `{feature-name}-PRD.md` in the root directory

## Additional Guidelines

- Be specific about user interactions and workflows
- Include data models and API requirements where relevant
- Consider error handling and edge cases
- Think about monitoring and observability requirements
- Address security and privacy concerns
- Consider mobile and accessibility requirements where applicable

Start by asking clarifying questions if the feature description is unclear, then proceed to create the comprehensive PRD.
