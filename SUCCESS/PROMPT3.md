Modify @DYNAMIC_TABLES_ADVANCED.ipynb , a juptyer notebook for Snowsight, by creating a new section of cells that showcase the types of queries supported in dynamic table refreshes.  

After creating these new dynamic table examples, prove their refresh mode by 
(1) inserting new records to trigger a refresh and 
(2) pulling the latest results from DYNAMIC_TABLE_REFRESH_HISTORY

For now, just add the query examples from the Basic Incremental Operations section in @QUERY_EXAMPLES.md

Also, update the notebook metadata for each cell with a custom name using just 1 to 3 appropriate titles for the cell.  Each cell name should be unique.  No spaces allowed, underscores are ok.
